title: PieceType Interface
file_version: 1.1.3
app_version: 1.18.32

This code defines an interface called `PieceType` that represents a type of game piece. The interface has properties such as `name`, `point`, and `image` to describe the piece. It also has a function called `movePattern` that determines the set of possible positions the piece can move to based on its current position, the positions of other player's pieces, and the positions of all open pieces.
