# File Structure

The file structure in our Chess game design follows a specific convention to ensure organization and maintainability. This section provides an overview of the file structure in our codebase.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet), the file structure is organized as follows:

*   `src/`: This directory contains all the source code files for the Chess game.

    *   `components/`: This directory contains reusable components used throughout the game.

    *   `models/`: This directory contains the data models used to represent the game state.

    *   `services/`: This directory contains the services responsible for handling game logic and communication with external APIs.

    *   `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions and helper classes used in the game.

    *   `views/`: This directory contains the different views and screens of the game.

The file structure follows a modular approach, where related files are grouped together in their respective directories. This helps in organizing the codebase and makes it easier to locate and maintain specific functionalities.

For example, to add a new service to the game, you would add the service file to the `services/` directory, as shown in the code snippet from `path/to/service.ts` (see snippet). This ensures that all services are centralized in one location, making it easier to manage and update them.

It is important to adhere to the file structure conventions in our codebase to maintain consistency and make collaboration easier for the development team.
