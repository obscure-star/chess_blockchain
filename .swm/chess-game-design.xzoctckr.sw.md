The game flow:

<br/>

This code snippet prompts the user to input a player color (white/black) for a game of Chess. It checks if the input is valid and continues to prompt the user until a valid input is provided. Once a valid input is received, the game starts with the chosen player color.

This code snippet defines a function called `startGame` that takes a `player` parameter. The main functionality of the code is to start a new game based on the chosen player. If the `player` is "white", it starts a new game with a `WhitePlayer` and a `BlackPlayer`. If the `player` is not "white", it starts a new game with a `BlackPlayer` and a `WhitePlayer`.

This code initializes the game by setting the `currentPlayer` and `otherPlayer` based on the `name` property of the `firstPlayer`. It then builds the game board and sets the pieces for both players.

This code snippet is a part of a game loop that keeps the game running until the player chooses to exit. It prompts the player for their move, validates the move, and handles various game conditions such as check and checkmate. It also updates the player's points, checks for valid input, and processes pawn promotion.
