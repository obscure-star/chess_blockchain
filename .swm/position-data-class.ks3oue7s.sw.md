file_version: 1.1.3

This code snippet defines a `Position` data class that represents a specific position on a game board. It has properties for the `row` and `column` coordinates, and a `pawnFowardMove` flag indicating if a pawn can move forward from this position. The `toString()` function is overridden to provide a string representation of the position, which includes the column and row coordinates. If the `pawnFowardMove` flag is true, it appends a 'p' to indicate a pawn's forward move.

# Simple Usage Example

To demonstrate the simple usage of the Position data class in our codebase, we will refer to the following code snippet:

As can be seen in the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet).

In this example, we will show how to create an instance of the Position class and access its properties.

1.  First, import the Position class from the appropriate module:

```kotlin
import chess.common.model.Position
```

2.  Create a new instance of the Position class:

```kotlin
val position = Position(10, 20)
```

3.  Access the properties of the position object:

```kotlin
println(position.x) // Output: 10
println(position.y) // Output: 20
```

By following these steps, you can create a new instance of the Position class and access its properties in your code.

For more advanced usage examples and edge cases, please refer to the corresponding sections in this document.
